### Details of PersonX dataset and how to generate images based on the system are as follows. 

The PersonX dataset is generated by the synthetic data engine PersonX that can synthesise images under controllable cameras and environment. For researching viewpoint, six backgrounds are used in this version (as shown in above figure), including three pure color backgrounds and three scene backgrounds. There are 1266 hand-crafted identities (547 females and 719 males) and each identety has 36 viewpoints (sampled every <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=0^{\circ}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?10^{\circ}" title="10^{\circ}" /></a> from <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=0^{\circ}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?0^{\circ}" title="0^{\circ}" /></a> to <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=0^{\circ}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?350^{\circ}" title="350^{\circ}" /></a> ), so the total number of images is 273,456 ( 36 <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\times" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\times" title="\times" /></a> 1266 <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\times" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\times" title="\times" /></a> 6).

### The Link of the Dataset
We release 3D models of the identeties and the 1266 models can be downloaded from the following links:<br>
[Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nXdrniA7IDgJDKq6FexFJA)<br>
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d2PuKD60qFpugbqYfMHtjKmRj9OUdPG4/view?usp=sharing)

### The Instructions of the Dataset
The package can be imported into any program of Unity directly. 
*  "person1-1266.unitypackage" is a Unity package that contains the original 3D models of the identities. You can double-click the package to import is it into your project. 
*  The version of Unity used in this work is [2018.1.8f1 Personal](https://unity3d.com/unity/whatsnew/unity-2018.1.8)  that can be downloaded from the [Unity Website](https://unity3d.com/).
*  The scenes (backgrounds) can be selected or designed based on your demand and there are many free sources in Unity Asset Store. If you want to use the scenes used in this work, please send an email to xxsunzrt@gmail.com.

How to get different viewpoints of the person?
* Import the scripts in "Scripts" into your project.
* Create a Game manager(Create Empty) in Unity and create two Camera and one Cube in the manager.

* Add the scripts on the three components as follows (or directly use the example manager in example_camera.unitypackage)

* Run the Game Manager in Unity can get the images of a person with different viewpoints.
